# Enterprise_Control

## Motor_Control

This code is for the Enterprise being built my the Drexel Theme Park Engineering and Design Group. To properly use the code, an Arduino, 4-channel relay, and simple switch circuit are required. The code is designed to control the Linear Actuator and the Motor of the Enterprise with one button. This button runs a set ride cycle with starts the motor, lifts up the arms, pauses, lowers the arm, and then stop the spinning. The code is set to try and level itself during the set up process of the Arduino script.

## Light_Control

Script that the Arduino in the center uses to Control the lights. Will write a few scripts that use the MAX 72XX IC and one that doesn’t. After evaluation of the code and performance of the hardware and LEDs, one will be put in production.

## RaspberryPi_Control
