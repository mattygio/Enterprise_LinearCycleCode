# Enterprise_LinearCycleCode

This code is for the Enterprise being built my the Drexel Theme Park Engineering and Design Group. To properly use the code, an Arduino, 4-channel relay, and simple switch circuit are required. The code is designed to control the Linear Actuator and the Motor of the Enterprise with 2 buttons, one for each. Currently, the code freezes while the Linear Actuator cycles but this is an item to be addressed in future versions. Also another iteration of the code might be that 1 button will start up and cycle the whole Enterprise.
